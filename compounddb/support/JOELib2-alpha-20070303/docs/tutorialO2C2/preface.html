>This a higgledy-piggledy mix of the cumulative organic chemistry knowledge i have collected during studying chemistry at the University of Tuebingen (Tuebingen, Germany) during 1995-2000.
    </P
><P
>Of course, i have created the collection for preparing my final exam. But as always, this is definitely not the work of one person, it is only a usefull collection to understand underlying mechanisms and find analoguous for organic reactions. The works of the professors at the University of Tuebingen and several organic chemistry books were used to create this colletion. Please have a look at the bibliography for further informations.</P
><P
>The next question is: why are you publishing such stuff QUESTIONMARK That is the most important point. I have found that everyone has a special preference to learn and store the huge amount of informations. Because organic chemistry requires also a lot of formalisms and molecular structures to be learned, i believe that an open organic chemistry content (O2C2) document will be helpfull. So everyone can extend the document, find and remove errors and the most important thing, everyone can use this O2C2 stuff to prepare an exam. E.g. to learn how to answer questions like, how do you create a 1,3-dicarbonyl-compound QUESTIONMARK</P
><P
>At all it is important to know that this document is the result of studying chemistry for 5 years during a common chemistry course of study at the University of Tuebingen. Furthermore the knowledge of the aministration work for the  <A

>JOELib libary</A
> was required to find a techniqual way to create a real open content document without requireing commercial programs. So i used the <A
HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/joelib"
TARGET="_top"
>JOELib libary</A
> to create images of molecular sructures, which is analogue to the long established equation mechanism under LaTeX. Of course there are other ways, but i coosed this one, because i can extend the image informations to be shown also, because <A

>JOELib</A
> is an open source library under the GPL license. Additionlly i reduced the number of different programs to use to a minimum.</P
><P
>Finally, this stuff is and was already a lot of work. I like critic only if this leads to a real improvement (constructive critic). So some critic with offering of man/woman power to improve things is very welcome. Critic with causing less work can be eventually handled by my own, but my Ph.D. is more important for me and this O2C2 is leisure time work,  please beare that in mind when demanding improvements.</P
